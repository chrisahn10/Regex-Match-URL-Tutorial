# Regular Expressions (Regex) Tutorial: URL Matching

Welcome to this Regex Tutorial! What are regular expressions? How do they work? Why are they so important in programming? In this tutorial, we'll explore these questions and more. Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern, commonly used for string matching and manipulation. In this guide, we'll dive into a regex used for matching URLs.

## Summary

The regular expression we will examine is designed to match URLs. URLs follow a specific pattern that includes a protocol, domain name, and optional path and query parameters. Our regex is:

```regex
/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/
```
This regex is capable of matching a wide range of URLs, including those with and without the HTTP/HTTPS protocol prefixes. It recognizes domain names and paths, handling a variety of top-level domains.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors (`^` and `$`) are used in this regex to denote the start and end of a line, respectively. They ensure the entire string matches the URL pattern.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers like `?` and `*` allow parts of the URL to be optional. For example, `https?:\/\/` means 'http://' or 'https://' is optional.

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping constructs (`()`) are used to group parts of the regex. In our regex, they separate the protocol, domain, top-level domain, and path.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions `[ ]` match any one out of a set of characters. For instance, `[\da-z\.-]` matches any digit, lowercase letter, period, or hyphen.

### Character Classes
`\d` is a character class in our regex, matching any digit. It's used within the domain part of the URL.

### Flags
This regex does not use any specific flags, but they could be added for case-insensitivity (`i`) or global search (`g`).

### Character Escapes
Character escapes like `\/` and `\.` allow special characters to be included in the search pattern. They are used for matching periods and slashes in the URL.
